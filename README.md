# ramenctl

Command line tool and Go module for managing and troubleshooting Ramen.

## Overview

Working with a complicated Kubernetes cluster is not easy.  In a typical
disaster recovery environment we have at least 3 connected Kubernetes
clusters with many components. The *ramenctl* project aims to make it
easier to manage and troubleshoot this challenging environment.

## Features

The project provides:

- The *ramenctl* command line tool, managing and troubleshooting ramen.
- The *ramenctl* Go module for integrating the ramenctl commands in other
  projects. This module is used to implement the
  [odf dr](https://github.com/red-hat-storage/odf-cli/blob/main/docs/dr.md) command.

## Installing

Download the *ramenctl* executable for your operating system and architecture
and install in the PATH.

To install the latest release on Linux and macOS, run:

```console
os="$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
machine="$(uname -m)"
if [ "$machine" = "aarch64" ]; then machine="arm64"; fi
if [ "$machine" = "x86_64" ]; then machine="amd64"; fi
curl --location --fail --silent --show-error --output ramenctl \
    https://github.com/ramendr/ramenctl/releases/latest/download/ramenctl-$os-$machine
sudo install ramenctl /usr/local/bin/
rm ramenctl
```

## Examples

Create a configuration file for Regional DR test environment:

```console
$ ramenctl init --envfile ramen/test/envs/regional-dr.yaml
```

Run disaster recovery tests:

```console
$ ramenctl test run -o rdr-test
⭐ Using report "rdr-test"
⭐ Using config "config.yaml"

🔎 Validate config ...
   ✅ Config validated

🔎 Setup environment ...
   ✅ Environment setup

🔎 Run tests ...
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" deployed
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" protected

   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" unprotected
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" undeployed
